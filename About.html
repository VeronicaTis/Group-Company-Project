        <h2>About Company</h2>
        <p>Our company called the Very-Cool Non Profit Organization aka VCNPO
            is a new organization. We noticed tht there is to many homeless
             people that are not getting enough help. Our company strives to help 
              as many of them as possible in any case we like to help them all. We
              want to help put clothes on all the backs of homeless people. We see
              them walking around eachday with hole filled clothes, or to small or big
              clothes. We want them to wear something that fits and is comfortable.
              We make clothes and also accept donations for us to hand out to them.
              You can also hlep buy donating at the <a href="Donate.html">Donation page</a>
              that we have set up. 
        </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>We plan to do many things in the future but for now we are 
            limited on things we can do to help. We still do those things
            to the best of our abilities, you can see the things we do on the
            <a href="Service.html">Services page</a>. Our goal for our company
            is to help over 1 million homeless people and more. That is a huge goal
            to hit but with the worlds help I have no doubt we can hit the target.
        </p>
        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>
            As far as what have acheived so far we have done many events in the past months.
            To see our upcoming events you can look on our <a href="Event.html">Event page</a>
            that we have. We have helped 1,000 homeless people get clothes on their backs.
            If you would like to voulonteer you can call or eamil us. We have only gained
            one sponsor so far for our organization. As time permits and our organization
            grows bigger we will gain more people to help this cause.
